1) ID number

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

2) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
3) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
4) perimeter
5) area
6) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
7) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
8) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
9) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
10) symmetry
11) Diagn√≥stico (Malignos 4, Benignos 2)
